# Monty Hall Problem Python Expiriment
Created a simple program to exploring Monty Hall Problem

## The Monty Hall problem goes like this..
A game show host presents three doors to the player of the game. Behind one of the doors is a brand new car! Behind the other two is something that the player doesn't want, like a goat. 
The player then selects a door that they believe the car is behind. 
After the player selects the door, the game show host then opens one of the two remaining doors the player didn't select and shows the car is not behind it. 
The game show host then asks if the player would like to switch to the single remaining door or stay at the door they are at. 
The question is, should the player switch or stay? Is there a statistical case to be made one way or the other.

## Conventional Wisdom says ...
If the odds are 1/3 but one choice is eliminated, the odds should be 50/50.
However, because the order of events and the specific nature of the problem, the statistical outcome is that 2/3 of the time, switching is better than staying.

## This application ...
Explores the actual outcome switching every time the option is presented and the actual outcome of winning by picking the door with the car. 
If the theory holds that odds are 2/3 if you switch, then the average of winning should have a limit of 66.66% as more games are played.
